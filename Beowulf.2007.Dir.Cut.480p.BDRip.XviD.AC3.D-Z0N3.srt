1
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:37,626
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

2
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,123
I want mead!

3
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,632
Give me some mead, my Queen!

4
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:53,076
Thank you, my beautiful Queen.

5
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,247
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

6
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,820
This is how it works, Aesher.

7
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:10,554
After you die,
you wouldn't really be dead

8
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:15,531
providing you have accepted him
as the one and only God.

9
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:29,013
All right, back! Back!

10
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,131
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

11
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:56,071
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!
I want a kiss!

12
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,302
Please, stop it!

13
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:04,408
More!

14
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,386
My thanes, my beautiful thanes!

15
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,720
One year ago, I, Hrothgar, your King

16
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:16,658
swore that we would
celebrate our victories

17
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:20,289
in a new hall, mighty and beautiful!

18
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:24,457
Have I not kept my oath? Yeah.

19
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,735
In this hall, we shall divide
the spoils of our conquests,

20
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,139
the gold and the treasure.

21
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:37,375
And this shall be a place of merriment,
joy, and fornication!

22
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,050
From now until the end of time,
I name this hall Herot!

23
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:53,962
Treasure!
Let's hand out some treasure!

24
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,991
Give me some of that!

25
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,729
From my conquests!

26
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,302
Unferth!

27
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:08,039
For Unferth, for Unferth,
my wisest advisor,

28
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:14,381
violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

29
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:19,321
Unferth, where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

30
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,722
I'm here, my King.

31
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:26,328
Unferth, come here, you ungrateful lout!

32
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:44,145
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

33
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:48,242
<i>He faced a demon dragon
When other men would freeze</i>

34
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:52,255
<i>And then, my lords, he took his sword
And brought it to its knees...</i>

35
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:54,154
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

36
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,819
<i>The greatest of our kings</i>

37
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,655
<i>He broke the dragon's wings</i>

38
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,391
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

39
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:08,334
<i>The kingdom fell in darkness
And shadows ruled the night</i>

40
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,376
<i>With no sign of dawn, he soldiered on
And brought us back to life</i>

41
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,274
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

42
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,244
<i>He never shook your faith</i>

43
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,077
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

44
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,811
<i>Let every cup be raised</i>

45
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,118
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

46
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,293
<i>He offered us protection
When monsters roamed the land</i>

47
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:40,525
<i>And one by one, he took them on
They perished at his hand</i>

48
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,494
Mead!

49
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:45,903
Mead!

50
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,238
Mead!

51
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,174
You're spilling it. Where's my mead?
You're spilling it.

52
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,040
You're spilling it!

53
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,073
Cain, you clumsy idiot!

54
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,776
How dare you waste the King's mead?

55
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:13,362
<i>He rose up like a savior
When every hope was gone</i>

56
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,433
<i>The beast was gored
and peace restored</i>

57
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,399
<i>His memory will live on</i>

58
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,129
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

59
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,330
<i>Let every cup be raised</i>

60
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,067
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

61
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,905
<i>Now and forever</i>

62
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,721
A sword! Give me a sword!

63
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:59,904
Come! Arm yourselves!

64
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,838
Stay down, my Lady!

65
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,719
- Give me a sword! A sword!
- My Lord!

66
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,734
No!

67
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,936
Fight me!

68
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:47,740
Fight me!

69
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,281
Fight me.

70
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,396
You fight me, damn you.

71
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,659
Nay.

72
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,210
What was that?

73
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,777
Grendel.

74
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,957
Grendel, what have you done?

75
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>What hafast flu done, Grendel?</i>

76
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:03,843
Fish and wolf and bear

77
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:05,939
and sheep or two,

78
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,245
<i>ac nan men.</i>

79
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,794
Men, Grendel.

80
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,965
They have slain so many of our kind.

81
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,964
Was Hrothgar there?

82
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:15,184
Good.

83
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,117
Good boy.

84
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:20,020
And tender.

85
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:36,467
Men, build another pyre!

86
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,042
There's dry wood behind the stables.

87
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,168
Then burn the dead.

88
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,874
And seal the hall!
Close the doors and the windows.

89
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,644
And by the King's order,

90
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:50,187
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

91
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,381
This place reeks of death.

92
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:58,021
The scops are singing
the shame of Herot

93
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,862
as far south as the middle kingdom
and as far north as the ice-lands.

94
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:06,198
I've let it be known that
I will give half the gold in my kingdom

95
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,795
to any man who can rid us of Grendel.

96
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,568
My King, for deliverance

97
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:15,305
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

98
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:17,472
With your permission,

99
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:22,019
shall we also pray
to the new Roman god, Christ Jesus?

100
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,987
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

101
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,954
No, Unferth, no.

102
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,521
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

103
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,223
What we need is a hero.

104
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,636
Hold your oars up!

105
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:48,869
And heave!

106
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:55,975
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

107
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:59,250
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

108
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,383
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

109
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,291
We're lost! Given to the sea!

110
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,954
The sea's my mother!

111
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:10,034
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

112
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,112
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

113
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:25,774
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

114
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:29,785
Heave!

115
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,557
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

116
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:38,718
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

117
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,197
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out

118
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,962
if we really want in!

119
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,034
Who wants to live?

120
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,631
We do!

121
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,406
Then pull your oars! Let's see you do it!

122
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,413
For Beowulf!

123
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,380
For gold!

124
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:00,781
For glory!

125
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,603
Heave! Heave!

126
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,210
Heave! Heave!

127
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:41,989
Beowulf.

128
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,526
Hold fast!

129
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,397
No.

130
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:07,373
Who are you?
From your dress, you are warriors.

131
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,976
Speak! Why should I
not run you through right now?

132
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,522
We are Geats.

133
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:15,251
I am Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow.

134
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:20,720
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar
in friendship.

135
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:23,858
They say you have a monster here?

136
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,334
They say your lands are cursed.

137
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:27,426
Is that what they say?

138
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,301
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame

139
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,932
from the frozen North
to the shores of Vinland.

140
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:33,806
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

141
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:38,211
I am Beowulf!
And I am here to kill your monster.

142
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,610
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough

143
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,155
to come around here
and die for our gold.

144
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,193
If we die, it'll be for glory, not for gold.

145
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,437
My Lord?

146
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:08,910
My Lord?
There are warriors outside. Geats.

147
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,378
But they are no beggars,

148
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,039
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

149
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,448
Beowulf? Ecgtheow's little boy?

150
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,214
Beowulf. Where is he? Where?

151
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:20,017
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome, my boy.

152
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:24,358
Welcome. Yes. How's your father?

153
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:25,861
Dead.

154
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:28,989
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

155
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, he was a brave man.

156
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,935
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

157
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,268
I've come to kill your monster.

158
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:40,805
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

159
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:45,281
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead

160
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:51,688
and many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

161
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:56,454
But in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them

162
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,257
but blood to be cleaned from the floor

163
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:02,899
and the benches, and the walls.

164
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:12,475
I have drunk nothing, yet.

165
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:17,010
But I will kill your monster.

166
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:22,142
He will kill the monster.
Did you hear that? Grendel will die.

167
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:25,313
- Grendel?
- Yeah, the monster is called Grendel.

168
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,592
Then I will kill your Grendel.

169
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:33,892
I, Beowulf,
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

170
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:37,161
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

171
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:42,205
and this troll of yours
will trouble you no more.

172
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:46,003
A hero! A hero!
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

173
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,477
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

174
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,411
and kill the monster in its den?

175
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:56,543
I have 14 brave thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

176
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:03,720
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead

177
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,591
famed across the world

178
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:10,258
and to feast
in your legendary mead hall.

179
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:13,997
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

180
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:17,939
Merrymaking in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

181
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,211
Well, then.

182
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,977
Open the mead hall! Let's drink!

183
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,957
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

184
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:16,296
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

185
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,868
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

186
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:23,406
Five days? In the name of Odin,
no wonder my loins are burning!

187
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:31,011
Beowulf, there you are.

188
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:34,050
I was thinking about your father.
Great man.

189
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:35,448
He was fleeing the Wulfings

190
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,044
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

191
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:41,056
- Heatholaf.
- That's it, yeah. That's right.

192
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:45,925
I paid the blood debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

193
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,057
So I saved his skin,
and you're here to save ours, that right?

194
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,874
All hail the great Beowulf,

195
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:05,642
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

196
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:11,785
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

197
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:17,794
But can I ask a question,
as a huge admirer of yours?

198
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:28,403
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of

199
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:33,443
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

200
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,644
Was that you?

201
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,908
I swam against Brecca.

202
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:48,186
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

203
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:51,159
someone else of the same name.

204
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:55,631
Because, you see,
the Beowulf I heard of

205
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:59,362
swam against Brecca and lost.

206
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:04,267
He risked his life and Brecca's

207
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:07,776
to serve his own vanity and pride.

208
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:10,346
A boastful fool.

209
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,312
And he lost!

210
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:18,248
So I thought it had to be someone else.

211
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:24,060
I swam against Brecca.

212
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:29,126
But victory was his, not yours.

213
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:34,330
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

214
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:38,136
Speaking only for myself here,

215
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,008
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment

216
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,706
against Grendel,

217
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:51,015
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

218
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,753
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

219
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:05,962
But it's true, I did not win the race.

220
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:11,405
<i>We swam for five days, neck and neck.</i>

221
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:15,502
<i>I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch</i>

222
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,582
<i>when this storm blew up</i>

223
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:22,443
<i>and with it came sea monsters.</i>

224
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:40,067
<i>Again and again, the monsters attacked!</i>

225
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,731
<i>Dark things from the sea's depths.</i>

226
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:57,112
<i>I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,</i>

227
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,781
<i>spilling their guts into the sea.</i>

228
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:13,892
Beowulf!

229
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:26,377
Then one of them seized me by its jaws

230
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,282
<i>and dragged me to the bottom.</i>

231
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:03,252
<i>I killed the monster with my own blade</i>

232
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:07,649
and I plunged it into its heart.

233
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:12,996
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

234
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:17,462
And you killed, what was it? 20?

235
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:20,903
Nine.

236
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,372
Last time it were three.

237
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:27,308
But would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

238
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:34,074
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

239
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:38,550
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

240
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,315
I know who you are.

241
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:47,122
They say you killed both your brothers

242
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:51,065
when you witnessed them
having knowledge of your mother.

243
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:56,602
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

244
00:27:56,707 --> 00:28:01,167
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

245
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,543
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

246
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,912
without fear of retaliation.

247
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:09,349
Tonight will be different!

248
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:14,322
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting
for him, not frightened sheep

249
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:21,856
like you.

250
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,469
Well done!

251
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:35,504
That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

252
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:38,638
So you will kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

253
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:47,785
Well, let's all drink in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

254
00:28:56,967 --> 00:29:01,063
<i>Lips ripe as the berries in June</i>

255
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:05,164
<i>Red the rose, red the rose</i>

256
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:09,541
<i>Skin pale as the light of the moon</i>

257
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:13,207
<i>Gently as she goes</i>

258
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:15,678
<i>Eyes blue as the sea and the sky</i>

259
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:18,186
Beowulf. Come.

260
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,256
<i>Water flows, water flows</i>

261
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:22,325
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

262
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:26,522
<i>Heart burning like fire in the night</i>

263
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,191
<i>Gently as she goes</i>

264
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,231
Come.

265
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:42,071
There.

266
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:45,005
The Royal Dragon Horn.

267
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,079
It is beautiful.

268
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:53,179
Isn't it magnificent?

269
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,656
She's the prize of my treasure.

270
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,719
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,
the dragon of the Northern moors.

271
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:02,924
Nearly cost me my life.

272
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:08,329
And there's a soft spot
under the throat, there.

273
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:11,896
See? You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

274
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,575
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

275
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,910
I wonder how many men
have died for love of her beauty.

276
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,885
Can you blame them?

277
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:31,461
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

278
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:37,490
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

279
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:41,970
You do me great honor.

280
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,708
It is we who are honored.

281
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,029
Is that your demon?

282
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:11,828
That was a wolf.
You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

283
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,870
No? Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

284
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:18,999
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

285
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,576
to ecstasy and back.

286
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,544
No other man
will ever be able to satisfy you again.

287
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:25,308
- Sorry.
- Come on!

288
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,849
- I said no and I meant no.
- Why not?

289
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:32,285
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

290
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:35,085
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

291
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,590
The hour is upon us.

292
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,828
This old man needs his sleep.

293
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:51,439
Where's my beautiful bedmate?
Come, my love.

294
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,444
In a moment.

295
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:59,545
Come, Wealthow,
let us pound the pillows.

296
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,285
Don't touch me!

297
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:01,910
Don't touch me!

298
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,913
That's the spirit, my girl.

299
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:08,020
My Lord!

300
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:17,730
Perhaps Her Majesty
could grace our ears

301
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:22,430
with one more melody
before we all retire?

302
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,745
It's the least I can do.

303
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:41,517
Beowulf, I'll hope to see you
in the morning, Odin willing.

304
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:46,487
And make sure
your thanes secure the doors.

305
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:50,499
Good night. Good night.

306
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:56,896
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea monsters.

307
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,773
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

308
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:11,244
<i>Just wait</i>

309
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,256
<i>Though wide he may roam</i>

310
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:19,853
<i>Always a hero comes home</i>

311
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:29,299
<i>He goes where no one has gone</i>

312
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:34,275
<i>But always a hero comes home</i>

313
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:59,959
<i>He goes where no one has gone</i>

314
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:06,566
<i>But always a hero comes home</i>

315
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:15,251
That was beautiful.

316
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,699
You need to go now, Your Majesty.

317
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,537
Of course. Grendel.

318
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:44,544
The demon is my husband's shame.

319
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:47,276
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

320
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:49,845
No, shame.

321
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,352
My husband has no other. No sons.

322
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,185
And he will have no more,
for all his talk.

323
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:01,355
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?

324
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,296
Nah. Not my type.

325
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,231
I know your type.

326
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,710
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

327
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:19,773
The creature has no sword, no armor.

328
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:23,319
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

329
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,684
We shall fight as equals.

330
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,780
And fate

331
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,621
shall decide.

332
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,907
Good. Tie it off with more chain.

333
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:00,622
Enough frican' about!

334
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,697
You're mad, you know that?

335
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,167
Yes.

336
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:22,702
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

337
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,449
I don't like the smell of this one,
my Lord.

338
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,654
The men are unprepared.

339
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,013
They're distracted.

340
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:37,192
Too many untended women here!

341
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:40,058
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

342
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:46,394
A warrior's mind must be unblurred,
my Lord.

343
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,266
Good night, Wiglaf.

344
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,534
And while you're sleeping,
what're we meant to do?

345
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:57,238
Sing! Loudly!

346
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:04,312
Well, you heard him.
He wants us to sing. So sing!

347
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:05,945
Olaf, sing!

348
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:14,390
<i>There was a dozen virgins</i>

349
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,260
<i>Friesians, Danes and Franks</i>

350
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:20,234
<i>We took them for some swifan
And all we got were wanks</i>

351
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:24,899
<i>Oh, we are Beowulf's army
Each a mighty thane</i>

352
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,636
<i>We'll pummel your asses
And ravage your lasses</i>

353
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:28,972
<i>Then do it all over again</i>

354
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,480
<i>The fattest of the virgins
I knew her for a whore</i>

355
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,881
<i>I gave her all my codpiece
And still she wanted more</i>

356
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:39,387
<i>Her sister was from Norway
She cost me 20 groats</i>

357
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:42,925
<i>She showed me there was more ways
Than one to sow my oats</i>

358
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:46,257
<i>Her mother was from Iceland
And she was mighty hot</i>

359
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:50,094
<i>She'd need a whole damn iceberg
To cool her burning...</i>

360
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:57,799
Grendel. He knocks.

361
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:03,805
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa.

362
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:04,902
She's ready for me
to taste her juicy fruit.

363
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:06,004
My Lord.

364
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,887
Patience, patience, my love.

365
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:17,090
No! Hondshew! No!

366
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:31,768
Swife me! It's the frican' monster!

367
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:28,085
I swear, the bastard has no pintel!

368
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,995
- No pintel.
- Aye.

369
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:36,523
- The demon shrinks!
- It shrinks! It shrinks!

370
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:00,506
Demon!

371
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:43,952
Your bloodletting
days are finished, demon!

372
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,395
It speaks. It speaks!

373
00:42:55,405 --> 00:43:00,570
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.

374
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:04,579
I am the teeth in the darkness,
the talons in the night.

375
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:08,048
Mine is strength and lust and power!

376
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:10,346
I am Beowulf!

377
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:38,037
Grendel's arm!

378
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:40,816
You've done it!

379
00:43:43,152 --> 00:43:44,585
He's done it!

380
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:49,223
He's torn the limbs from the beast!
Beowulf has killed him!

381
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:54,219
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

382
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,026
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

383
00:43:57,133 --> 00:44:00,159
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

384
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:05,197
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon!

385
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:08,740
Odin be praised.

386
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:13,737
- Go tell the scops. Spread the word!
- Yes, my Lord.

387
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:20,145
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

388
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,124
Our nightmare is over.

389
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:27,853
Come to bed, my sweet.

390
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:35,497
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son! It's time you did your duty.

391
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:39,234
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

392
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,140
I should never have told you.

393
00:44:47,483 --> 00:44:49,508
I should never have told you.

394
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,771
My poor son.

395
00:45:26,122 --> 00:45:28,852
Sleep now, my son.

396
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:37,693
Who murdered you, my son?

397
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:49,104
<i>He will pay, meen darling.</i>

398
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,782
Beowulf.

399
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,522
They were great warriors.

400
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:49,164
They died a foul death.

401
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:53,868
They were murdered by a foul creature
from the depths of hell.

402
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:57,537
The bards
will sing of their glory forever.

403
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,987
Come, let us drink to their memory.

404
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:09,887
I want you to raise the first cup.

405
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:13,484
I am not in the mood for merrymaking.

406
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,759
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

407
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:22,229
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,
do we not?

408
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:25,435
Aye.

409
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,874
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

410
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,681
this place for me
has been a hall of sadness.

411
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,286
And for all of us,

412
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:41,982
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed, and death.

413
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:46,152
But today,
the monster's reign has ended.

414
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:50,460
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

415
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:54,730
I wonder if Beowulf's strength is only
in his arms, or in his legs as well,

416
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:56,702
all three of them?

417
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:01,208
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

418
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,643
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

419
00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:06,214
Bring it here!

420
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,646
Wealthow, my love,

421
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:12,647
why don't you do the honors?

422
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:28,863
For you, my Lord.

423
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,110
Thank you, great King.

424
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,577
And all of you,

425
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:52,026
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

426
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:55,121
I was asleep when he arrived.

427
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:59,292
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

428
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:04,669
He stood 20 feet tall,
possessing the strength of 10 men.

429
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:09,643
I looked at him and said,
"I am Beowulf!"

430
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:54,205
Brave thane.

431
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,609
My Queen.

432
00:51:09,331 --> 00:51:10,958
I love you.

433
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,424
I want you, my King.

434
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:15,902
Only you.

435
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:20,105
<i>My hero, meen looviyend.</i>

436
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,071
I don't understand.

437
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,412
Where's your husband?

438
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:28,110
Dead.

439
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:31,111
Dead?

440
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:34,820
This is a dream.

441
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:39,158
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

442
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:42,196
Me, darling? A dream?

443
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:49,436
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

444
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:26,407
In the name of Odin!

445
00:52:28,043 --> 00:52:30,011
Is Grendel not dead?

446
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:34,239
Has he grown his arm anew?

447
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,682
It's not Grendel.

448
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:39,310
Not Grendel? Then who?

449
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:40,888
His mother.

450
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:44,624
It's Grendel you killed.

451
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:49,323
I had hoped his mother
had left the land long, long ago.

452
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,628
How many monsters must I slay?

453
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:58,265
Grendel's mother? Father?
Grendel's uncle?

454
00:52:58,374 --> 00:53:01,707
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

455
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,141
She is the last of them.

456
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:04,576
With her gone,

457
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,241
demonkind will slip back
into the darkness from whence it came.

458
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,840
Where it belongs.

459
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:14,150
And the mother's mate?
Where is Grendel's father?

460
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:20,828
Grendel's father
can do no harm to man.

461
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:26,565
Beowulf,

462
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:32,235
I was wrong to doubt you before,
and I shall not again.

463
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:36,437
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

464
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:40,343
Granted.

465
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:42,678
Cain! Cain!

466
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:57,398
Take my sword.
It belonged to my father's father.

467
00:53:57,499 --> 00:53:59,763
It's called "Hrunting."

468
00:53:59,868 --> 00:54:03,463
That sword is no match
for demon magic.

469
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:07,068
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

470
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:16,608
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers.

471
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:19,884
They were hasty words.

472
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:26,625
Unferth, I may not return.

473
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:31,564
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

474
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:36,067
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

475
00:54:45,514 --> 00:54:48,176
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

476
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,088
are you still with me?

477
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,058
To the end.

478
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:26,380
Look.

479
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:34,492
She's probably a water demon.

480
00:55:34,596 --> 00:55:36,530
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

481
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:37,894
I know.

482
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:42,031
Do you want me to go in with you?

483
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:43,764
Good.

484
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:45,362
I'll be here.

485
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,197
I see you've brought me treasure.

486
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,733
Show yourself!

487
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:07,875
What are you?

488
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:58,857
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

489
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,648
The Bee-Wolf.

490
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:23,816
The bear.

491
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,429
Such a strong man you are.

492
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,762
With the strength of a king.

493
00:59:44,473 --> 00:59:47,704
The king you will one day become.

494
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:54,506
What do you know of me, demon?

495
00:59:54,616 --> 00:59:58,985
I know that underneath your glamour

496
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:03,353
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

497
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,492
My glamour?

498
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:12,966
One needs glamour to become a king.

499
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:21,001
A man like you could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

500
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:25,111
Your story would live on

501
01:00:25,213 --> 01:00:30,845
when everything now alive is dust.

502
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:39,590
Beowulf.

503
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,861
It has been a long time

504
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:47,697
since a man has come to visit me.

505
01:00:48,804 --> 01:00:51,329
I need no sword to kill you.

506
01:00:53,575 --> 01:00:56,669
Of course you don't, my love.

507
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:01,841
You took a son from me.

508
01:01:03,752 --> 01:01:06,721
Give me a son, brave thane.

509
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:11,022
Stay with me.

510
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,955
Love me.

511
01:01:16,198 --> 01:01:18,132
Love me

512
01:01:18,233 --> 01:01:24,468
and I shall weave you riches
beyond imagination.

513
01:01:25,907 --> 01:01:28,432
I shall make you

514
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:32,908
the greatest king that ever lived.

515
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:45,651
As long as you hold me in your heart

516
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:51,256
and this golden horn
remains in my keeping,

517
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:55,192
you will forever be king.

518
01:01:57,906 --> 01:01:59,737
Forever strong,

519
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,601
mighty

520
01:02:03,378 --> 01:02:05,437
and all powerful.

521
01:02:07,115 --> 01:02:10,278
This I promise.

522
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:19,654
This I swear.

523
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:40,847
My Lord.

524
01:02:42,784 --> 01:02:44,911
It's dead, my Lady.

525
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:49,787
When I finished off
Grendel's monstrous mother,

526
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,950
I severed the brute's head.

527
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:54,924
Our curse is lifted.

528
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:58,860
Our curse is lifted. Odin be praised!

529
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:00,867
Beowulf be praised!

530
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,837
Our curse is lifted.

531
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,532
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!

532
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:11,579
Into the sea, quickly.

533
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:18,643
I plunged Hrunting
into Grendel's mother's chest

534
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,655
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

535
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,225
the creature sprang back to life,

536
01:03:25,327 --> 01:03:29,889
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

537
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,133
Till Ragnarok, huh?

538
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:40,405
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

539
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:48,742
More mead, my Lord?

540
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,976
Aye.

541
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:55,651
And the drinking horn, do you have it?

542
01:03:56,424 --> 01:03:57,550
No.

543
01:03:59,027 --> 01:04:03,896
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

544
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:06,331
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

545
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:08,902
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

546
01:04:10,505 --> 01:04:14,373
When she was dead, I looked for it,
but it was gone forever.

547
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:19,339
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

548
01:04:21,249 --> 01:04:24,446
First, the hero and I must talk.

549
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:27,418
Beowulf.

550
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:38,297
So you brought back
the head of Grendel.

551
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,658
What about the head of the mother?

552
01:04:42,637 --> 01:04:45,435
With her dead and cold in the bog,

553
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,998
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

554
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:52,206
Did you kill her?

555
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:57,576
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

556
01:04:59,387 --> 01:05:03,289
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

557
01:05:04,326 --> 01:05:08,422
But answer me, did you kill her?

558
01:05:14,669 --> 01:05:18,799
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

559
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:30,008
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

560
01:05:30,585 --> 01:05:32,712
He can bother me no more.

561
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:38,584
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

562
01:05:40,428 --> 01:05:41,986
Not anymore.

563
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,089
Not anymore.

564
01:05:47,602 --> 01:05:49,263
Listen to me!

565
01:05:49,371 --> 01:05:51,168
Listen to me!

566
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:58,872
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

567
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:03,280
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

568
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:05,910
and laid its mother in her grave...

569
01:06:06,021 --> 01:06:08,683
- To Beowulf!
- Long live Beowulf!

570
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,918
...and because I have no heir,

571
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,919
I have no sons,

572
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,893
I declare that on my death,

573
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:24,062
all that I possess, my kingdom,

574
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:28,167
my hall of sadness and shame,

575
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:32,635
and even my lovely young Queen,

576
01:06:34,883 --> 01:06:36,350
my Wealthow,

577
01:06:39,888 --> 01:06:42,857
everything, everything

578
01:06:46,995 --> 01:06:51,056
I leave to this, our hero.

579
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,464
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

580
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:57,838
I have spoken!

581
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,811
When I am gone,

582
01:07:03,912 --> 01:07:08,406
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

583
01:07:18,293 --> 01:07:19,658
Beowulf!

584
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,822
My Lord.

585
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,735
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

586
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:45,744
Hrothgar!

587
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,989
He must have fallen.

588
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:30,228
- All hail King Beowulf.
- All hail King Beowulf.

589
01:08:30,331 --> 01:08:32,629
All hail King Beowulf.

590
01:08:35,637 --> 01:08:37,332
King Beowulf.

591
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,167
Archers.

592
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,072
Archers!

593
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:49,909
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

594
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:51,808
This is slaughter.

595
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:57,215
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

596
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,513
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

597
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:01,646
It's going to be a short song.

598
01:10:01,756 --> 01:10:03,189
Now, can you blame them?

599
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:05,020
Your legend is known
from the high seas

600
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:07,356
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

601
01:10:07,462 --> 01:10:09,362
You are the monster slayer.

602
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:11,864
We men are the monsters now.

603
01:10:13,902 --> 01:10:16,700
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

604
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:20,104
The Christ God has killed it,

605
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:25,236
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

606
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,110
fear and shame.

607
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:32,152
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

608
01:10:32,921 --> 01:10:35,116
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

609
01:10:35,223 --> 01:10:36,690
Leave him!

610
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,756
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

611
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:44,229
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

612
01:10:44,332 --> 01:10:46,061
Coward!

613
01:10:46,768 --> 01:10:48,793
Kill me yourself!

614
01:10:48,903 --> 01:10:52,464
Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

615
01:10:52,574 --> 01:10:55,668
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

616
01:10:55,777 --> 01:10:56,903
Stop!

617
01:11:07,255 --> 01:11:10,622
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

618
01:11:13,628 --> 01:11:15,061
Let him up.

619
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:22,831
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

620
01:11:24,339 --> 01:11:29,675
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

621
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,612
I'm Finn of Frisia

622
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:40,847
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

623
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:42,980
Only if you kill me!

624
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:46,957
Otherwise, you're nothing.

625
01:11:47,862 --> 01:11:52,390
You think you're the first to try to kill me,
or the hundredth?

626
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:57,103
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

627
01:11:57,205 --> 01:12:00,606
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

628
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:05,270
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

629
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,680
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

630
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,884
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

631
01:12:16,991 --> 01:12:20,051
Someone give him a sword, or I'II...

632
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:23,988
You'll what? Kill me?

633
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:29,300
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

634
01:12:46,587 --> 01:12:49,613
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

635
01:12:51,526 --> 01:12:56,122
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

636
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,964
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

637
01:13:05,073 --> 01:13:07,075
He has a story to tell.

638
01:13:36,304 --> 01:13:37,794
Your Majesty?

639
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:40,106
Are you hurt?

640
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:43,299
Not a scratch.

641
01:13:50,618 --> 01:13:52,643
So beautiful.

642
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,818
And so young.

643
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:59,426
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

644
01:13:59,527 --> 01:14:03,554
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

645
01:14:03,664 --> 01:14:06,224
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

646
01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:09,531
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

647
01:14:11,172 --> 01:14:16,041
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

648
01:14:17,278 --> 01:14:21,715
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

649
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:27,381
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

650
01:14:28,623 --> 01:14:30,386
Perhaps tonight?

651
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:34,427
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

652
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:36,895
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

653
01:14:37,465 --> 01:14:40,434
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

654
01:14:40,535 --> 01:14:44,494
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

655
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,597
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

656
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:53,213
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

657
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,053
I see you've survived.

658
01:15:04,892 --> 01:15:06,757
Alas, my Queen,

659
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:11,458
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

660
01:15:11,566 --> 01:15:13,830
You are not a widow,

661
01:15:13,935 --> 01:15:14,924
yet.

662
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:20,501
How comforting, my husband.

663
01:15:22,844 --> 01:15:26,371
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

664
01:16:31,245 --> 01:16:32,712
Unferth.

665
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,573
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

666
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:38,879
I have something for the King.

667
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,119
What is it?

668
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:44,157
I said I have something for the King.

669
01:16:44,258 --> 01:16:46,658
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

670
01:16:46,761 --> 01:16:48,922
You will show it to me first.

671
01:16:49,263 --> 01:16:51,094
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

672
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:53,894
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

673
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:55,332
The King

674
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,200
needs to see what?

675
01:17:06,514 --> 01:17:09,972
Lost and now found.

676
01:17:19,293 --> 01:17:21,693
A gift fit for a king.

677
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:27,434
Do you recognize it?

678
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,740
Where did you find this?

679
01:17:33,841 --> 01:17:39,006
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

680
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:42,708
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

681
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,684
My Lord,

682
01:17:47,488 --> 01:17:48,955
isn't this...

683
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:03,933
So, Lord Beowulf,

684
01:18:10,111 --> 01:18:14,741
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

685
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,479
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

686
01:18:19,587 --> 01:18:21,817
Please, please don't kill me!

687
01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:24,982
Where did you find this treasure?

688
01:18:25,092 --> 01:18:27,993
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

689
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,995
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

690
01:18:31,098 --> 01:18:32,326
Stop.

691
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,566
Where?

692
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:44,238
Up, up on the moors.

693
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:49,011
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

694
01:18:50,451 --> 01:18:51,850
Is that all?

695
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:56,147
No demon? No witch?

696
01:18:58,959 --> 01:19:00,256
No woman?

697
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:15,700
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

698
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:21,680
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

699
01:19:21,782 --> 01:19:27,379
<i>Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!</i>

700
01:19:32,093 --> 01:19:36,587
Look at you. You're nothing,

701
01:19:36,697 --> 01:19:39,393
an empty nothing.

702
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,263
Come forth!

703
01:19:41,368 --> 01:19:43,359
Show yourself!

704
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,807
Even with all your riches,

705
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:53,574
your kingdom, your power, your glory

706
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:56,916
and your women.

707
01:19:59,787 --> 01:20:04,053
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

708
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:08,492
your pretty little bedwarmer,

709
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:11,326
or your wise Queen?

710
01:20:14,034 --> 01:20:15,592
What are you?

711
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,208
I'm something you left behind,

712
01:20:23,878 --> 01:20:24,845
Father!

713
01:20:50,204 --> 01:20:52,195
Another restless night?

714
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:00,076
It's all right, girl.

715
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,949
I'm not going to eat you.

716
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:13,652
He has bad dreams.

717
01:21:14,728 --> 01:21:17,026
They've been coming more often.

718
01:21:18,265 --> 01:21:21,666
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

719
01:21:28,909 --> 01:21:31,377
He calls your name in his sleep.

720
01:21:33,447 --> 01:21:34,880
Does he?

721
01:21:40,821 --> 01:21:44,587
I believe he still holds you in his heart.

722
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:47,755
Do you?

723
01:21:51,398 --> 01:21:53,366
I often wonder

724
01:21:55,736 --> 01:21:57,226
what happened.

725
01:21:57,338 --> 01:21:58,771
To us?

726
01:22:04,645 --> 01:22:06,476
Too many secrets.

727
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,054
God, help us.

728
01:22:42,349 --> 01:22:45,477
What? What do you want of me?

729
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:51,287
I have a message for my father.

730
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:54,691
Tell me! What did this?

731
01:22:54,862 --> 01:22:59,196
I saw our whole village burn.
Children screaming as they died!

732
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,269
I saw it, Your Majesty,
vomiting fire and smoke!

733
01:23:02,369 --> 01:23:04,269
Damn you! What was it?

734
01:23:04,371 --> 01:23:05,804
A dragon!

735
01:23:07,074 --> 01:23:09,372
- It's Unferth, my Lord!
- Unferth.

736
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,943
You say a dragon did this? Stop!

737
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,581
You had an agreement.

738
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:21,452
You would not be harmed.

739
01:23:21,555 --> 01:23:24,490
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

740
01:23:24,591 --> 01:23:27,082
The agreement is ended.

741
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:29,219
Who? Who said that?

742
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,628
"The sins of the fathers!"

743
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:35,693
That's the last thing I heard.

744
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:40,206
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

745
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,037
The sins of the fathers!

746
01:23:44,445 --> 01:23:47,414
Sins of the fathers!

747
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,639
The sins of the fathers!

748
01:23:52,019 --> 01:23:54,749
The sins of the fathers!

749
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:04,390
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

750
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:07,262
It is our only hope if I fail.

751
01:24:07,368 --> 01:24:08,665
My Lord.

752
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:14,407
Don't go, I beg you!

753
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,908
You are free. I release you.

754
01:24:18,245 --> 01:24:22,238
Find a good man and bear him children.
But bear him a son.

755
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,249
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

756
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:26,911
I am not the man you think me to be!

757
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:31,320
You're a great man! And a hero!
This I know to be true.

758
01:24:31,425 --> 01:24:34,326
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

759
01:24:48,342 --> 01:24:50,469
Very impressive, dear.

760
01:24:50,577 --> 01:24:54,013
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

761
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:57,177
I'm sure it did.

762
01:25:02,156 --> 01:25:04,681
Why don't you take that poor girl

763
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:08,091
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

764
01:25:08,195 --> 01:25:10,823
Let some young hero save us.

765
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,357
What?

766
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:16,528
And let the nightmare
start all over again?

767
01:25:18,138 --> 01:25:22,040
No. I visited this horror
upon my kingdom.

768
01:25:23,177 --> 01:25:26,374
- I must be the one to finish her.
- Her.

769
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,916
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

770
01:25:35,022 --> 01:25:36,853
A beauty so costly?

771
01:25:43,163 --> 01:25:47,190
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

772
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,766
I was weak.

773
01:25:56,643 --> 01:25:58,201
I am sorry.

774
01:26:01,415 --> 01:26:03,508
So, so sorry.

775
01:26:08,522 --> 01:26:11,355
I have always loved you, my Queen.

776
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,594
And I you.

777
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,105
Keep a memory of me,

778
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:31,803
not as a king or a hero,

779
01:26:33,514 --> 01:26:35,004
but as a man,

780
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:38,316
fallible and flawed.

781
01:26:55,569 --> 01:26:57,537
This is the place.

782
01:26:57,638 --> 01:27:00,198
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

783
01:27:04,111 --> 01:27:06,909
Wiglaf, I have no sons,

784
01:27:07,981 --> 01:27:12,350
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds

785
01:27:12,452 --> 01:27:13,783
that you shall be king.

786
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:16,412
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

787
01:27:19,993 --> 01:27:23,394
Great friend,
there is something you should know.

788
01:27:23,497 --> 01:27:26,261
Nay! There is nothing I should know.

789
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:29,597
You are Beowulf.
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

790
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:32,194
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

791
01:27:32,306 --> 01:27:34,740
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps

792
01:27:34,841 --> 01:27:37,173
and get on with our bloody lives!

793
01:27:42,516 --> 01:27:45,178
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No.

794
01:27:47,087 --> 01:27:48,315
Good.

795
01:28:34,835 --> 01:28:36,268
Beowulf.

796
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:39,931
It has been a long time.

797
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:51,779
Take your damned horn
and leave my land in peace.

798
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:57,586
Too late, my love.

799
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:20,813
Odin's swifan balls!

800
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:31,623
It's heading for Herot!

801
01:30:35,155 --> 01:30:36,713
Now!

802
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:47,089
Hrothgar.

803
01:31:57,904 --> 01:32:00,896
Come on, come on!
Come on! Come on!

804
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:13,848
Damn you!

805
01:32:20,393 --> 01:32:23,794
I'll have your lizard head on a spike!

806
01:34:34,394 --> 01:34:36,055
No!

807
01:36:30,477 --> 01:36:31,842
My Lord!

808
01:37:01,207 --> 01:37:05,303
No!

809
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,129
Over here! Attend the Queen.

810
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,400
- Attend the Queen.
- Attend the Queen.

811
01:40:24,243 --> 01:40:27,144
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

812
01:40:28,848 --> 01:40:30,941
Let's get you to a healer.

813
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:33,041
Not this time, old friend.

814
01:40:33,753 --> 01:40:35,983
You are Beowulf.

815
01:40:36,089 --> 01:40:39,547
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

816
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:42,988
Do you hear her?

817
01:40:45,932 --> 01:40:47,661
I hear nothing.

818
01:40:48,968 --> 01:40:51,766
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

819
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:53,566
- No, my Lord.
- My...

820
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:57,006
You killed Grendel's mother
when we were young.

821
01:40:58,478 --> 01:41:00,070
They sing of it.

822
01:41:01,814 --> 01:41:04,248
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

823
01:41:06,619 --> 01:41:08,052
Too late.

824
01:42:15,388 --> 01:42:16,787
He was

825
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,350
the bravest of us.

826
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:26,530
He was the prince

827
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:30,198
of all warriors.

828
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:36,597
His name will live forever.

829
01:42:47,987 --> 01:42:50,512
His song shall be sung forever.
