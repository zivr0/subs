1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,373
Blue Moon

2
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,672
You saw me standing alone

3
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,839
Without a dream in my heart

4
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:56,467
Without a love of my own

5
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,896
Blue moon

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,360
You knew just what I was there for

7
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,159
You heard me saying a prayer for

8
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:19,448
Someone I really could care for

9
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:27,379
And then there suddenly appeared before me

10
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:33,261
The only one my arms will ever hold

11
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:38,933
I heard somebody whisper please adore me

12
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:45,056
And when I looked
the moon had turned to gold

13
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,937
Blue moon

14
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,196
Now I'm no longer alone

15
00:01:55,157 --> 00:02:00,657
Without a dream in my heart

16
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,996
Without a love of my own

17
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,716
And then there suddenly appeared before me

18
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:19,351
The only one my arms will ever hold

19
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:25,561
I heard somebody whisper please adore me

20
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:31,399
And when I looked
the moon had turned to gold

21
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,242
Blue moon

22
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:40,952
Now I'm no longer alone

23
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:46,746
Without a dream in my heart

24
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,747
Without a love of my own

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,680
Blue moon

26
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,438
That's East Proctor,
and all about here are the moors.

27
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,559
I go this way.

28
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,395
Thanks for the ride, sir.
You have lovely sheep.

29
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,651
Boys, keep off the moors.
Stick to the roads, and the best of luck.

30
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,613
Thanks again. I'm gonna miss you.

31
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,284
Bye, girls.

32
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,908
- You cold?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,078
- Good.
- Jack!

34
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,541
- David.
- You're not having a good time, are you?

35
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,422
Oh, I don't know. I mean, look around.

36
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,466
Isn't this a fun place?

37
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,592
- Well, I like it here.
- Right.

38
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,638
- Northern England first, Italy later.
- Right.

39
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,640
- I mean, we've got three months.
- Right.

40
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,097
Those sheep shit on my pack.

41
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,284
You think she'll meet me in Rome?

42
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,873
I think Debbie Klein's a mediocre person
with a good body.

43
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,160
There's nothing mediocre about
Debbie Klein's body.

44
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,244
She's a jerk.

45
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,958
You're talking about the woman I love.

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,460
I'm talking about a girl you wanna fuck.
So give me a break.

47
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,382
All right. Well, I have to make love to her.

48
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,472
It's really very simple. She has no choice.

49
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,553
It just fascinates me how much energy
you spend on somebody so dull.

50
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,558
There's nothing dull about that body.

51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,645
We've known Debbie, what,
since the eighth grade?

52
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,732
How many years of foreplay is that?

53
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,647
She says she likes me too much.

54
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,624
What are you worried about
Debbie Klein for, anyway?

55
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
There are gonna be plenty of girls
on this trip.

56
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,905
We're off to a great start.

57
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,906
- Say, "Knock, knock."
- Knock, knock.

58
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,919
- Who's there?
- Who?

59
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,916
- Don't you get it?
- What?

60
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,133
You don't get that joke?
All right, I'll try another.

61
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,264
- Say, "Knock, knock."
- What?

62
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,301
- Say, "Knock, knock."
- Who's there?

63
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:47,555
- No. No, no, no. You say, "Knock, knock."
- Knock, knock.

64
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,309
- Who's there?
- Who?

65
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,311
No. You don't...

66
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,879
You're right. It is a pub.

67
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,965
Okay, what do you say,
we go in for a little food, drink, rest?

68
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,637
"The Slaughtered Lamb"?

69
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,637
That's kind of strange.

70
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,480
- Where's the lamb?
- It's probably inside getting cold. Come on.

71
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,444
No, really.
What kind of ad is that for a pub?

72
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,565
I don't know. Would you rather the Hilton?

73
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,072
All right, but whatever happens,

74
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,235
- it's your fault.
- It's my fault.

75
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,493
- Right.
- All right. Come on.

76
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,791
Hello.

77
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,297
Hi. Nice to see you.

78
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,132
It's very cold outside. May we come in?

79
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,525
- Yes. Do you have any hot soup?
- No.

80
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,156
- Do you have any coffee, then?
- No.

81
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,776
Do you have any hot chocolate?

82
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,788
We have spirits and beers. If it's something
hot that you want, you can have tea.

83
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,581
- Then you have tea?
- No.

84
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,875
- Oh.
- But I can make some for you, if you like.

85
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,205
- Oh, yes, please.
- Oh, yes, please.

86
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,269
- Nice-looking group.
- Hey, listen, at least it's warm in here.

87
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,894
Look at that.

88
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,694
- Yeah, what about it?
- It's a five-pointed star.

89
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,066
Maybe the owners are from Texas.

90
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,913
- Remember the Alamo.
- I beg your pardon?

91
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,620
- Oh, he was just joking.
- Joking?

92
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:18,084
I remember The Alamo. I saw it once
in London, in Leicester Square.

93
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,038
She means in the cinema,
that film with John Wayne.

94
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,750
Oh, yeah, of course.

95
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,671
Checkmate.

96
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,427
Right. With Laurence Harvey.
Everybody dies in it. Very bloody.

97
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,601
Bloody awful, if you ask me.

98
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,391
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear
the one about that rushing...

99
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,188
Let me speak!

100
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,363
- Ask him what the candles are for.
- You ask him.

101
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,453
All right, then. I shan't tell it.
No, no, you've had your chance.

102
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,582
It's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.

103
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,080
It's used in witchcraft.

104
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,502
Lon Chaney, Jr., in Universal Studios,
maintained that's the mark of the Wolf Man.

105
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,543
I see. You want me to ask them if they're
burning candles to ward off monsters.

106
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,502
- Right.
- Wrong.

107
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,678
All right, then! There was this airplane

108
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,350
over the Atlantic on its way to New York,

109
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,854
and it was full of men
from the United Nations.

110
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,943
- Go on, ask him.
- You ask him.

111
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,570
So halfway over the ocean
the engines run low on petrol.

112
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,991
So, they have to lighten the plane.

113
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,200
So they heave out all the baggage,
but it's still too heavy.

114
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,235
So they chuck out all the seats,
but it's still too heavy.

115
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,787
Finally, this Frog, he steps up, shouts,
"Vive la France," and leaps out.

116
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,134
- Then an Englishman, he steps up, shouts...
- Hear, hear.

117
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,131
..."God save the Queen,"  and he leaps out.

118
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,626
But the plane is still too heavy.

119
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,929
So the Yank delegate from Texas,
he steps up, shouts,

120
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,690
"Remember the Alamo,"
and chucks out the Mexican!

121
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,651
Remember the Alamo.

122
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,949
Excuse me. What's that star on the wall for?

123
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,297
You made me miss.

124
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,552
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,676
I've never missed that board before.

126
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,059
Jack, we'd better go.

127
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,226
Are you kidding? I'm starved.

128
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,615
There's no food here.

129
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,155
- Shall we go, Jack?
- Apparently so.

130
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,829
- You can't let them go.
- How much do we owe you?

131
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,199
Nothing, lads. Go. God be with you.

132
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,037
- Thank you.
- Wait!

133
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,455
You just can't let them go.

134
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,625
Go. Stay on the road.

135
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,178
Keep clear of the moors.

136
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,926
- Thank you.
- Beware the moon, lads.

137
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,897
Yeah.

138
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,895
- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.

139
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,694
Let's go up the road and see if there's
an inn or something.

140
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,899
"Beware the moon"?

141
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,818
Yeah, I know, Jack, but come on.
I'm freezing.

142
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,028
Where the hell are we going?

143
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,867
Anywhere. I just want to get away
from The Slaughtered Lamb.

144
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,163
Where to now, Kessler? The Duck's Breath?

145
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,167
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sure we'll find something else.

146
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,090
- Weird fucking place.
- It was, man.

147
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,959
But, boy, they could play darts.

148
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,923
You can't let them go.

149
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,553
Should the world know our business?

150
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,386
- It's murder, then!
- Then murder it is.

151
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,307
It's in God's hands now.

152
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,151
- What do you think was wrong?
- I have no idea.

153
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,082
Maybe that pentangle
was for something supernatural.

154
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,539
Oh, I see.

155
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,251
And they were too embarrassed to talk
about it because they just felt so silly.

156
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,632
- They were ashamed.
- Yeah.

157
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,497
Oh, please, don't rain!

158
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,672
Oh! Of course.

159
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,215
- Oh, David.
- Yes, I'm well aware

160
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,561
of how pleasant the weather is in Rome
at the present time, thank you.

161
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:49,061
Santa Lucia

162
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,734
- Santa Lucia
- Santa Lucia

163
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:58,065
- Santa Lucia
- Santa Lucia

164
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:02,203
- Santa Lucia
- Santa Lucia

165
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,526
It's-a-cold and-a-wet out here!

166
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,873
Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,960
No one brought them here.
No one wanted them here.

168
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,594
- You could have told them.
- Are you daft?

169
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,631
And what do you think they'd say?

170
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,547
They'd think us mad.

171
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,215
Listen.

172
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,686
Do you hear it?

173
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,608
We must go to them.

174
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,065
I heard nothing.

175
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,080
Nor I.

176
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,786
Did you hear that?

177
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,708
- I heard that.
- What was it?

178
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,224
Could be a lot of things.

179
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,216
Yeah?

180
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,433
- A coyote.
- There aren't any coyotes in England.

181
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,805
- The hound of the Baskervilles?
- Pecos Bill?

182
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,693
- Heathcliff.
- Heathcliff didn't howl.

183
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,940
No, but he was on the moors.

184
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,034
It's a full moon.

185
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,819
- "Beware the moon."
- "Beware the moon."

186
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,783
"And stick to the road." Oops.

187
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,701
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.

188
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,249
Yeah.

189
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,007
Hey, wait a minute. We're lost.

190
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,595
Shit, David. What is that?

191
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,810
- I don't know. Come on.
- "Come on" where?

192
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,640
Anywhere.
I think we should just keep moving.

193
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,452
It's moving.

194
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,372
It's circling us.

195
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,790
Oh, fuck.

196
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,291
- What's the plan?
- Plan?

197
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,129
Let's just keep walking.

198
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,303
That's right. A lovely stroll on the moors.

199
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,633
Tra-la-la-la. Isn't this fun?

200
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,931
It's in front of us.

201
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,103
Do you think it's a dog?

202
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,978
Oh, shit. What is it?

203
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,775
Yeah, it's a sheepdog or something.
Come on. Turn slowly. Let's walk away.

204
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,861
Nice doggie.

205
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,945
Good boy.

206
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,200
- Come on, Jack. Walk away.
- Walking away. Yes.

207
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,072
Here we are walking away.

208
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,450
- Can you see anything?
- No.

209
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,749
- Sounds far away.
- Not far enough. Come on.

210
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,130
- But, Jack.
- What?

211
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,212
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

212
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,077
- I'll tell you when we get there.
- Okay, 'cause...

213
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,053
You really scared me, you shithead.

214
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,704
You gonna help me up or what?

215
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,350
Jesus! Fuck! Jesus!

216
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,149
Jesus! Fuck! Oh, God! Help! Help!

217
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,244
It's killing me!

218
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,412
Jack.

219
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,463
Jack.

220
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,959
Jack?

221
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,680
Mr. Kessler?

222
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,297
Mr. Kessler?

223
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,675
I'm going to look into your eyes.

224
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,272
Is he all right?

225
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,147
Yes, I should think.

226
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,650
He called out just now.

227
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,107
He's American, you know.

228
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,236
Dr. Hirsch's gonna fetch one of them
embassy fellas to see him.

229
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,584
- His chart says he's from New York.
- Oh, I think he's a Jew.

230
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,501
- What makes you say that?
- I've had a look.

231
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,791
Really, Susan, that wasn't very proper.

232
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,499
Besides, it's common practice now.

233
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,496
Nurse Gallagher, Nurse Price is quite right.

234
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,175
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler called out just now.

235
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,389
Nurse Gallagher, surely you perform
some function here at the hospital?

236
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,224
- Yes, Doctor.
- Then get on with it.

237
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,178
Yes, Doctor.

238
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,407
Can I be of service, Nurse Price?

239
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,950
- Dr. Hirsch?
- Go about your duties.

240
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,204
Yes, Doctor.

241
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,786
- Oh, Nurse Price.
- Yes, Doctor?

242
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,082
- What exactly did he call out?
- He said, "Jack."

243
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,748
That would be Jack Goodman,
the boy who was killed.

244
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,212
What happened to them?

245
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,378
The police report said
they were attacked by an escaped lunatic.

246
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,431
Must have been a very powerful man.

247
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,479
Although I don't see
that it's any concern of yours, Nurse Price.

248
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,349
No, sir. Of course, sir.

249
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,061
Good day, Doctor.

250
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,338
Hello, David.

251
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:40,852
I'm Dr. Hirsch.
This is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.

252
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,020
- Where am I?
- You're in a hospital in London.

253
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,399
London?

254
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,781
Where's Jack?

255
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,743
David, I'd like you to prepare yourself.

256
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,533
Your friend is dead.

257
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,027
What?

258
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,289
Shit.

259
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,498
Jack is dead?

260
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,588
Hi. I'm Mr. Collins of the American Embassy
here in Grosvenor Square.

261
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,261
Both Mr. Goodman's parents and your
parents have been notified of your injuries

262
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,801
and everything's in order.

263
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,140
Who are you people?

264
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,676
What's going on here? Where's Jack?
Get your hands off me.

265
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,693
- Let go of me. I wanna see Jack!
- Nurse!

266
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,519
- I wanna see Jack.
- Mr. Kessler!

267
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,034
I appreciate
how upsetting this must be for you.

268
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,320
Please, Mr. Kessler!

269
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,653
Twenty milligrams Seconal IV, please.

270
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,199
I appreciate how upset you are,
but this is no reason for hysterics.

271
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:48,615
Mr. Kessler?
Mr. Kessler, try not to excite yourself.

272
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,828
I shall come back and check on your
progress and send a report to your parents.

273
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,129
The police have requested to interview you,
and I have given them permission to do so.

274
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,927
Thank you very much, Mr. Collins.
He'll rest now.

275
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,350
I'm sure everything will be fine
once he's adjusted.

276
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,348
He's had quite a shock.

277
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:09,351
These dumb-ass kids. They never appreciate
anything you do for them.

278
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,935
How long have I been here?

279
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,073
You've been unconscious
since you were brought in three weeks ago.

280
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,491
Three weeks?

281
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,279
You've suffered some cuts and bruises.

282
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,703
Lost a little blood. Nothing serious.
Black and blue for a while.

283
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,827
You'll have some dueling scars to boast of.

284
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,214
That lunatic must have been
a very fierce fellow.

285
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,709
They say a madman has the strength of 10.

286
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,382
Lunatic?

287
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,880
We've given you a strong sedative.
Rest now.

288
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,381
Nurse Price will see to all your needs.
You rest.

289
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,842
- It wasn't a lunatic.
- I beg your pardon?

290
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,314
- It was an animal.
- What?

291
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,427
A wolf.

292
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,767
Did he say a wolf?

293
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,523
Yes, I believe he did.

294
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,149
Oh, I'm sure I shall.

295
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,486
If I survived Rommel,

296
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,370
I'm sure I can survive another excruciating
evening with Roger Matheson.

297
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,737
Be a good girl. Bye, now.

298
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,331
Yes?

299
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,009
Inspector Villiers and Sergeant McManus
are here to see you, Doctor.

300
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,719
Send them in.

301
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,472
- Dr. Hirsch.
- Come in. Come in. Please sit down.

302
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,431
- Some tea?
- No, thank you.

303
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,595
I'd like some tea, please.

304
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,769
Maybe not. No, thanks. Maybe later.

305
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,364
- No problem.
- No, thank you, Doctor.

306
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,895
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?

307
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,741
We understand the Kessler boy
has regained consciousness.

308
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,275
Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,582
Has Mr. Kessler said anything
regarding the attack on the moors?

310
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,578
Excuse me. Yes?

311
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,586
- Roger Matheson, Doctor.
- I'm not here.

312
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,249
- He's on the telephone.
- Tell him I'm out.

313
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,087
Tell him I've passed away,
an old war wound.

314
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,756
Just tell him I'm dead! No more calls.

315
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,294
I'm sorry if I conflict with your report,
Inspector,

316
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,921
but Jack and I were not attacked by a man!

317
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,749
- So you've said.
- He may have a point, sir.

318
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,255
Two strong boys would be able to defend
themselves against one man.

319
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,590
Sergeant McManus,

320
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,094
are you suggesting that David and Jack
were in fact attacked by some animal

321
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:53,808
and that the officialdom of East Proctor
has conspired to keep it a secret?

322
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,891
We have an autopsy report on the murderer,
who was shot in the act by the local police.

323
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,228
We have two witnesses to the crime.

324
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,279
You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler,
if I consider your testimony

325
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,150
as coming from someone
who has gone through a terrible shock.

326
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,608
Inspector, the boy seems all right
to me, and...

327
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,448
And what, Sergeant?

328
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,543
- And I don't rightly know, sir.
- That is precisely my point.

329
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,076
David, as far as we're concerned,
the matter is now closed.

330
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,377
We will trouble you no further.
Good day. Doctor.

331
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,885
- There were witnesses?
- So they said.

332
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,386
How could there have been witnesses?
It was so dark.

333
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,064
We were running, and I fell,

334
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,153
and Jack went to help me up,
and this thing came from nowhere.

335
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,019
I don't know what they're talking about.

336
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,149
In time, I'm sure it'll all come back to you.

337
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,275
Doctor, my memory is fine.

338
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,822
It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.

339
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,035
- Hello, Benjamin.
- No.

340
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,958
- No what?
- No.

341
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,880
Well, all right, then, be like that. Here.
Swallow this.

342
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,756
Want some water?

343
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,385
- Feeling better?
- No!

344
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,267
What a lot of lovely comics you've got.

345
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,273
- Do you like them?
- No.

346
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,940
Right.

347
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,566
How's the patient in 21?

348
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:16,868
- Yes, yes, yes.
- How did he look?

349
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,411
- What do you mean how did he look?
- Does he seem depressed?

350
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,655
Do you think he'll eat his food?

351
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,416
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist.
I push things around.

352
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,960
- What happens to them, I don't know.
- Thank you.

353
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,808
- Mr. Kessler.
- Yes?

354
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,855
You haven't eaten your lunch.

355
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,185
Well, I'm not very hungry, thank you.

356
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,237
- I'm afraid you have to eat something.
- What?

357
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,908
You have to eat something.

358
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,912
No, really, thanks, I'm not hungry.

359
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,794
You put me in an awkward position,
Mr. Kessler.

360
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,883
- How did I do that?
- You're to take these after you've eaten.

361
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:15,053
What sort of nurse would I be if I failed in
so simple a task as handing out some pills?

362
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,263
You can leave the pills.
I'll take them later.

363
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,545
Sorry.

364
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,940
- Oh, come on, Nurse Price.
- You can call me Alex.

365
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,861
Come on, Alex.

366
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,566
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?

367
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,744
You can call me David.

368
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,202
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?

369
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,289
You know, this is absurd.
I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

370
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,155
Right.

371
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,601
- Let's try a little harder, shall we?
- Would you give me a break?

372
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,907
Will I have to take such drastic action
again, David?

373
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,607
You've never had bad dreams before?

374
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,493
Sure, as a kid, but never so real.
Never so weird.

375
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,784
Did you get a good look at the man
who attacked you?

376
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,197
Doctor, I told you. It wasn't a man.

377
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,004
It was an animal. A big wolf or something.

378
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,712
A rabid dog.

379
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,379
Let's have a look, shall we?

380
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,761
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I was traumatized,
but Jack was torn apart.

381
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:23,014
I saw him. A man can't do that
to someone with his bare hands.

382
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,393
You'd be surprised
what horrors a man is capable of.

383
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,977
- Did you see Jack?
- No.

384
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,479
In fact, your wounds had been cleaned
and dressed before you arrived here.

385
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:36,983
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor?
Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?

386
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,527
I really don't know.

387
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,360
Then why the hell are you so quick
to disbelieve me?

388
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:46,195
- You think I'm crazy.
- David, please. The police are satisfied,

389
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,785
and I'm certain if there were a monster
roaming around Northern England,

390
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,622
we'd have seen it on the telly.

391
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,964
Now you'll be leaving this hospital in
three or four days.

392
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,633
Please, remain sane.

393
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,719
At least until
you're no longer our responsibility.

394
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,971
Dr. Hirsch.

395
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,432
I'd rather not be by myself.

396
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,730
I'll send someone in to keep you company.

397
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,336
You're a very beautiful girl.

398
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,968
I thought you were asleep.

399
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,585
I was.

400
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,768
- Shall I read to you?
- Yeah, okay.

401
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,515
A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court

402
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,444
by Samuel L. Clemens.

403
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,651
This is after the preface
but before chapter one.

404
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,109
"A Word of Explanation."

405
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,073
"It was in Warwick Castle that I came
across the curious stranger

406
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,406
"who I'm going to talk about.

407
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,696
"He attracted me by three things:
his candid simplicity,

408
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,328
"his marvelous familiarity
with ancient armor,

409
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,125
"and the restfulness of his company,
for he did all the talking.

410
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,054
"We fell together, as modest people will,

411
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,459
"in the tail of the herd
that was being shown through,

412
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,179
"and he at once began to say things
which interested me."

413
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,175
- ...number tonight.
- Puppetry is an art form, Piggy.

414
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:34,184
- You call that violence "art"?
- Well, violence belongs with puppetry.

415
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,228
He is hitting her.

416
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,230
That's Punch and Judy.
They've always been violent.

417
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,942
- Punch and Judy?
- It's good. It's a good, aggressive behavior.

418
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,293
- Better than my act?
- I'm just watching a puppet show right now.

419
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,700
I was going to bite you very badly.

420
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,279
Get the door!

421
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,369
I'll get it.

422
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,622
I've got a song for tonight.

423
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,163
All right, all right. Hold your horses.

424
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,000
All right, already.

425
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,471
Stop!

426
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,906
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

427
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,370
Hello. Have you been up long?

428
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,206
I've just had a nightmare.

429
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,884
Not to worry. I have just the thing.

430
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,137
Alex!

431
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,556
Holy shit.

432
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,452
You're up!
Good morning, and a good day to you.

433
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,533
We have quite a meal here for you,
bacon and eggs,

434
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,328
porridge, orange juice and toast with jam.

435
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:22,082
Good stuff there. Now you eat it up, and
I'll be back for the dishes when you finish.

436
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,456
Good morning.

437
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,564
Can I have a piece of toast?

438
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,823
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.

439
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,651
Thanks a lot.

440
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,609
No. I can't take this.

441
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,284
Am I asleep now, awake or what?

442
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,792
I realize I don't look so hot, David,

443
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,161
but I thought you'd be glad to see me.

444
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,674
David! You're hurting my feelings.

445
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,383
Hurting your feelings?

446
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,973
Has it occurred to you
that it might be unsettling

447
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,929
to see you rise from the grave to visit me?

448
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,350
Sorry to be upsetting you, David,
but I had to come.

449
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,135
Aren't you supposed to be buried
someplace in New York?

450
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,056
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral.

451
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,060
I was surprised at how many people came.

452
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,979
Why should you be surprised?
You were a very well-liked person.

453
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,528
- Yeah. I was, wasn't I?
- Well, I liked you.

454
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,161
Debbie Klein cried a lot.

455
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,660
Oh, God. Am I asleep now or what?

456
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,873
So... So you know what she does?

457
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:44,793
She's so grief-stricken, she runs
to find solace in Mark Levine's bed.

458
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,883
Mark Levine?

459
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,837
An asshole. Life mocks me even in death.

460
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,627
I'm going completely crazy.

461
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,388
- David!
- What?

462
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:03,806
Now, I'm really sorry to be upsetting you,
but I have to warn you.

463
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,439
- Warn me?
- We were attacked by a werewolf.

464
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,772
- I'm not listening to this.
- On the moors.

465
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,528
We were attacked by a lycanthrope,
a werewolf.

466
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,106
I was murdered. An unnatural death.

467
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:21,954
And now I walk the Earth in limbo
until the werewolf's curse is lifted.

468
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,037
- Shut up.
- The wolf's bloodline must be severed.

469
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,248
The last remaining werewolf
must be destroyed.

470
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,054
It's you, David.

471
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,138
- What?
- Please believe me.

472
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,313
You'll kill people.

473
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,849
- Nurse!
- Listen to me!

474
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,475
Nurse!

475
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,980
The supernatural, the power of darkness,
it's all true.

476
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,358
The undead surround me.

477
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,943
Have you ever talked to a corpse?

478
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,448
It's boring.

479
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,410
I'm lonely.

480
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,911
Take your life, David.

481
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,287
Kill yourself before you kill others.

482
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,461
Please don't cry.

483
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,264
Beware the moon, David.

484
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,191
David. David!

485
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,484
David, what's wrong?

486
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,702
I'm a werewolf.

487
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,566
A werewolf?

488
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,535
Are you all right now?

489
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,753
I don't know.
I'll let you know the next full moon.

490
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:55,455
David, you're going to be discharged
tomorrow. Will you be all right?

491
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,299
My friend Jack was just here.

492
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,303
- Your dead friend Jack?
- Yes.

493
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,465
He told me that
I will become a monster in two days.

494
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,024
What do you think?

495
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,734
What do I think?

496
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,573
About the possibility of you becoming
a monster in two days

497
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,150
or about visits from dead friends?

498
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,527
I was dreaming again?

499
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,663
Yes, I would think so.

500
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,495
I think so, too.

501
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,588
Do you have somewhere to stay in London?

502
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,595
Remember, I'm just a working girl.
So don't expect too much.

503
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,889
- Do you live by yourself?
- Yes.

504
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,521
Good.

505
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,146
There's a shop on the corner.
We'll get some food.

506
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,241
This stuff's expensive.

507
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,368
It's outrageous. My pay can't
possibly keep up with inflation.

508
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,328
How do you live?

509
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,212
Carefully.

510
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,733
This is the living room.

511
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:20,903
You mind if I get rid of this?

512
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,034
- Oh, please.
- Thank you.

513
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,956
- The kitchen.
- Very nice.

514
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,551
- Closet.
- Charming.

515
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,722
- The bathroom.
- Lovely.

516
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,555
The bedroom.

517
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,322
There's only one bed.

518
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,571
I'll be perfectly honest with you, David.

519
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,325
I'm not in the habit of bringing home stray,
young American men.

520
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,328
I should hope not.

521
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,501
I find you very attractive
and a little bit sad.

522
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,338
Go on.

523
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,340
I've had seven lovers in my life,
three of which were one-night stands.

524
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,180
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

525
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,636
Perhaps you'd like to watch telly
whilst I take a shower.

526
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,573
Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance

527
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:54,407
With the stars up above in your eyes

528
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,581
A fantabulous night to make romance

529
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,627
Beneath the cover of October skies

530
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,799
And all the leaves on the trees are falling

531
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,379
To the sound of the breezes that blow

532
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,886
And I'm trying to please to the calling

533
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,760
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low

534
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:21,939
And all the night's magic
seems to whisper and hush

535
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:27,357
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine

536
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,069
In your blush

537
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:34,695
Can I just have
one more moondance with you

538
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,156
My love

539
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,535
Can I just make some more romance with you

540
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,917
My love

541
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,676
You're not real.

542
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,310
Don't be a putz, David.

543
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,274
Come here.

544
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,193
A nurse, huh?

545
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:37,988
Come on.

546
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,144
What are you doing here?

547
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,231
I wanted to see you.

548
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,726
- Hi, David.
- Put that down.

549
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,743
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.

550
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,661
I'm sorry I'm upsetting you, David,
but you don't understand what's going on.

551
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,492
I understand, all right.

552
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,537
You're one of the "undead,"
and I'm a werewolf.

553
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,457
Yes. That's right.

554
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,711
Get out of here, Jack.

555
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,917
Tomorrow night's the full moon.

556
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,669
You're gonna change. You'll become...

557
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,219
I know. I know. A monster.

558
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,772
You gotta kill yourself, David,
before it's too late.

559
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,815
Are you really dead, Jack?

560
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,071
What do you think?

561
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,526
I think I've lost my mind.

562
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:05,408
I think you're not real. I think
you're just another part of a bad dream.

563
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,910
You gotta believe me, David.

564
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,128
Believe what?
That tomorrow night beneath the full moon

565
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,540
I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people?

566
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:18,666
- Bullshit!
- Oh, God damn it, David, please believe me.

567
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,965
You'll kill and make others like me.

568
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,096
I'm not having a nice time here.

569
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,143
You gotta take your own life.

570
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,770
I will not accept this. Go away.

571
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,820
David?

572
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,655
This is not pretend, David.

573
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,909
I will not be threatened
by a walking meat loaf!

574
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,695
David.

575
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,247
What's wrong? I heard voices.

576
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,964
It was just me, Alex. Just me being crazy.

577
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,548
Are you all right?

578
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,972
No, I don't think so.

579
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,931
Come back to bed now.

580
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,136
Do I seem crazy to you?

581
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,938
David, what is the matter?

582
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,398
I just saw Jack again.

583
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,652
Where? Here?

584
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,031
Yeah.

585
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,704
What did he say?

586
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,447
He said that tomorrow
I'll turn into a monster.

587
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,748
Do you believe him?

588
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,544
Do you believe me?

589
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,923
I believe that you're very upset.

590
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,882
I believe that you loved him very much

591
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,837
and that somehow you blame yourself
for his death.

592
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,223
Did you ever see The Wolf Man?

593
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,849
- Is that the one with Oliver Reed?
- No, the old one.

594
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,596
I don't think so.

595
00:46:56,022 --> 00:47:00,032
Bela Lugosi bites Lon Chaney, Jr.,
and he turns into a werewolf.

596
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,900
- Why are you telling me this?
- No, listen.

597
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,582
Claude Rains is Lon Chaney's father,
and he ends up killing him.

598
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,158
So?

599
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:16,752
Well, I think that a werewolf can only
be killed by someone who loves him.

600
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,341
What are you talking about?

601
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,472
I don't know what I'm talking about.

602
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,927
I'm torn between feeling very sorry for you

603
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,265
and finding you terribly attractive.

604
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,433
A drink for a very cold man.

605
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,597
Good afternoon. What can I get you?

606
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:03,109
- A Campari soda would do very nice, I think.
- Sorry, love.

607
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,615
Oh, well, then a small Guinness will suffice.

608
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,374
Nasty business with those two
young American boys, wasn't it?

609
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,875
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm right.

610
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,712
A few weeks back. Last full moon, wasn't it?

611
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:31,891
I mean, the escaped lunatic,
the one who killed the boy.

612
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,471
A thousand thanks, madam. There we are.

613
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,433
Well, that was around here, wasn't it?

614
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,437
Where are you from, sir?

615
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,645
London.

616
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,475
Excuse me.

617
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,685
Knight takes pawn?

618
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,605
What?

619
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,909
Oh, yeah.

620
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,865
Cheers.

621
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:14,339
- Oh, what's that?
- Oh, that's been there for 200 years, sir.

622
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,598
We were going to paint it out,
but it's traditional, so we left it.

623
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,394
I see.

624
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,362
So, you've heard nothing of this incident?

625
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,111
- Incident?
- The murder.

626
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,195
- You a police officer?
- Oh, good Lord, no, no.

627
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:40,873
No, I'm a doctor. I work in the hospital
where they brought the Kessler boy.

628
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,035
He was talking about werewolves. Monsters.

629
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,207
I happened to be in the area, so I thought...

630
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,955
You thought what?

631
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,465
I thought I'd look into the boy's story.

632
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,005
Story about werewolves?

633
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,391
Really, sir.

634
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,650
Like a game?

635
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,856
- Well?
- I think not.

636
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,396
Surely I'm not that impressive.

637
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,568
No. No, sir, you're not.

638
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,448
I don't feel like a game.

639
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,331
- You off now?
- Aye. I'll not be long.

640
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,418
I just wanna check on the dogs.

641
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,172
The dogs are fine.

642
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,303
I'll just check.

643
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,980
Quite a long drive to London.
Do you have anything to eat?

644
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,105
No. There's no food here.

645
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,026
There's nothing for you here, sir.

646
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,120
Well,

647
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,163
I'll be on my way, then.

648
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,237
Hello.

649
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,907
Now, listen. That boy's in danger.

650
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,742
I mean,

651
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,122
it were a mistake to let him leave here.

652
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,960
There's something wrong with this place.

653
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,964
That much I understand.

654
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:56,457
It's the one who lived.

655
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:00,338
He's the one who's in danger,
and not just him.

656
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,103
Others will be, too.

657
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,926
It's almost full moon.

658
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,524
He'll change, and he'll...

659
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,105
That's enough!

660
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,776
That's enough.

661
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,961
If you get too anxious,
call me at the hospital, okay?

662
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,218
Okay.

663
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,510
- I've left those pills for you.
- A doper werewolf.

664
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,926
I'm off.

665
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,059
See you later.

666
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,414
Thanks a lot, dog.

667
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,679
Hello.

668
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,008
Snarl!

669
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:37,081
...lost 28 pounds
in less than a fortnight.

670
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,094
Rab Smith, neat, dapper little character.

671
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:47,553
There's a lot said about big,
gross darts players, but Rab...

672
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,636
Crazy girl asked me to meet her guy
before she married him...

673
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:51,973
In the News of the World tomorrow.

674
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,057
...and he totally blew my mind.

675
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:57,903
Nina Carter reveals her amazing life
as pop star, beauty queen and top model.

676
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,190
Read about her nude pictures.

677
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,693
The only ones I regret were among the first.

678
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:02,855
The men in her life.

679
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,453
There may have been a lot,
but I don't regret one of them.

680
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,359
Nina tells the News of the World
how she had fun

681
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,528
and found trouble earning too much money,
getting in too much mischief.

682
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,407
In the end, it nearly destroyed me.

683
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,704
Don't miss the naked truth
about Naughty Nina,

684
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,038
starting in the News of the World tomorrow.

685
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:28,474
I see the bad moon rising

686
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,811
I see trouble on the way

687
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:39,229
I see earthquakes and lightning

688
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:44,191
I see bad times today

689
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,278
Don't go around tonight

690
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,533
Well, it's bound to take your life

691
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,117
There's a bad moon on the rise

692
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,792
I'm not hungry.

693
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:00,455
I hear hurricanes a-blowing

694
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:05,214
I know the end is coming soon

695
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,892
I feel rivers overflowing

696
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,966
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

697
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,016
Don't go around tonight

698
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:23,107
Well, it's bound to take your life

699
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,860
There's a bad moon on the rise

700
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,488
All right

701
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:34,025
Fe-fi-fo-fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman.

702
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,157
I'm still not hungry.

703
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,011
Hope you got your things together

704
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,138
Hope you are quite prepared to die

705
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,562
Looks like we're in for nasty weather

706
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,862
One eye is taken for an eye

707
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,743
Well, don't go round tonight

708
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,195
Well, it's bound to take your life

709
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,159
- How are we feeling tonight?
- No!

710
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,748
- No what?
- No!

711
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,547
Benjamin, have you ever been
severely beaten about the face and neck?

712
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,419
- No!
- I thought not.

713
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,511
Now, go to sleep. Sweet dreams...

714
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,684
- No!
- No!

715
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:41,484
No.

716
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:51,493
Blue moon

717
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,200
You saw me standing alone

718
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,661
Jesus Christ!

719
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,327
Without a dream in my heart

720
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,830
What?

721
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,042
God! What?

722
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,752
Without a love of my own

723
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,042
Oh! Oh! I'm burning up!

724
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,626
Blue moon

725
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,216
You knew just what I was there for

726
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,840
God!

727
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:19,641
You heard me saying a prayer for

728
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,894
Someone I really could care for

729
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:30,324
Then suddenly there appeared before me

730
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:35,403
The only one my arms could ever hold

731
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:39,494
Then I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me

732
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,581
When I looked the moon had turned to gold

733
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,623
Oh, help me!

734
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,462
Blue moon

735
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,581
Please, help me!

736
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:51,379
Help me!

737
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,593
Now I'm no longer alone

738
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:58,014
Without a dream in my, my, my, my heart

739
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,513
I didn't mean to call you a meat loaf, Jack!

740
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,967
Without a love of my own

741
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:07,347
Blue, blue, blue, blue moon

742
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,360
You saw me standing alone

743
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:17,108
Without a dream in my heart

744
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,528
Without a love, without a love
without a love

745
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,618
Of my own

746
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:27,044
Blue moon

747
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:32,036
You knew just what I was there for

748
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:37,218
You heard me saying a prayer for

749
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:41,801
Someone I really could care for

750
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:46,886
Then suddenly there appeared before me

751
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:51,403
The only one my arms could ever hold

752
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:56,149
Then I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me

753
01:00:56,528 --> 01:01:00,448
And when I looked
the moon had turned to gold

754
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,371
Blue moon

755
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:10,035
Now I'm no longer alone

756
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:15,247
Without a dream in my, my, my, my heart

757
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:20,260
Without a love of my, my, my, my own

758
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,760
Without a love

759
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,987
That's 1.50, please.

760
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,868
- Thank you.
- Night.

761
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,871
- Which one, Harry?
- Number 39.

762
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,703
- Hey, let's go round the back.
- Why?

763
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:51,289
Come on. We'll give Sean a scare.

764
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,538
- It's freezing cold!
- Oh, come on.

765
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,625
You're crazy, Harry.

766
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,595
What are we doing?

767
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:15,015
We're going to creep up round
the stairs and give him a ripe old scare.

768
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,066
- Hey, did you hear something?
- Just now?

769
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,653
- Yes.
- No.

770
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,832
Sean, those hooligans are in the park again.

771
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,788
Aren't you ready yet?
They'll be here any minute.

772
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:38,098
There's something going on out there.

773
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,586
- Is Nurse Price on duty this evening?
- Yes, Doctor.

774
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:47,514
Nurse Gallagher, do you know if Nurse Price
has seen the Kessler boy since his release?

775
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,097
I don't know.

776
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,273
Yes, Doctor. I have.

777
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,689
Come to my office, Nurse Price.

778
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,449
Is anyone there?

779
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,329
Sit down, Alex.

780
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,838
I was in East Proctor today.

781
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,959
- I'm concerned about David.
- Yes, sir.

782
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,176
There's a full moon. Where is he?

783
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,221
- He's at my flat.
- What's the number?

784
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,345
- I'm off at midnight, and...
- Your number.

785
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,239
Is that you, Harry?

786
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,724
- No, he's not there.
- He's not?

787
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,102
Alex,

788
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,064
has David persisted
in his werewolf fantasies?

789
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,860
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?
Is this more serious than I know?

790
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,492
I tried to investigate the attack.
There are no records.

791
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:30,284
Case was closed.
Now they've "misplaced" the file.

792
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,947
David's lacerations were cleaned
and dressed before he arrived here.

793
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,540
Yet supposedly,
no other doctor examined him before I did.

794
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:40,044
The Goodman boy's in the ground already.
He's no use to us.

795
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:45,006
So, I went to the pub in East Proctor today,
where I was convinced of two things.

796
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:49,301
They were lying. There were no witnesses,
no escaped lunatic.

797
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,557
The whole community is hiding the truth
of what actually happened up there.

798
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,680
Surely, you don't mean...

799
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,558
David has suffered a severe trauma.

800
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:03,693
I myself witnessed some form of
mass neurosis in East Proctor.

801
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:08,244
If all the villagers believe that
Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf,

802
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,361
why shouldn't David?

803
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:13,447
And then it follows
that if he survived an attack by a werewolf,

804
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,450
wouldn't he himself become a werewolf
at the next full moon?

805
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:21,999
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours
and howling at the moon,

806
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,795
but in such a deranged state he might harm
himself or perhaps other people.

807
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:29,684
- What shall we do?
- I think we should call the police.

808
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,489
Here. Old Winston smells something.

809
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,745
- Let him go!
- Hey! Find what it is.

810
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:06,706
- That's it.
- Brave dog, that.

811
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,134
Here! Who's there?

812
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,394
That's not Winston.

813
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,557
Look. There!

814
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,810
What's...

815
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,063
Mary, mother of God!

816
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:18,994
Hello?

817
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,540
Is there someone there?

818
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,839
I can assure you
this is not in the least bit amusing.

819
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,644
I shall report this.

820
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,513
Good Lord.

821
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,616
Hello, wolves. Nice wolves.

822
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:12,003
I'm gonna... I'll be right back, okay?

823
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:15,093
Just take any calls.

824
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,337
Oh, boy.

825
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:31,016
No, Dr. Hirsch. He hasn't come back yet.

826
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,771
Yes, I will.

827
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:37,725
But I feel so helpless
just sitting around here doing nothing.

828
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,192
Yes, thank you.

829
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:42,863
Goodbye.

830
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,846
Excuse me.

831
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,150
Hey, kid!

832
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,494
Little boy with the balloons!

833
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,739
Come over here!

834
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,372
If you come over here, I'll give you a pound.

835
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,576
Two pounds.

836
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,300
I don't know who you are.

837
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:47,094
I'm the famous balloon thief.

838
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,305
Why would a thief want to give me
two pounds?

839
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,216
Here, I'll explain it to you.

840
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,059
Thank you.

841
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,702
Yes, love?

842
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,447
- A naked American man stole my balloons.
- What?

843
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,296
Twenty pence, please, sir.

844
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,762
Sorry.

845
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,502
Lot of weather we've been having lately.

846
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,943
Good morning!

847
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,952
- I'm freezing.
- David!

848
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,408
Where on earth have you been?

849
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:38,746
Alex, you won't believe this.

850
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:45,091
I've lost my mind. I woke up in the zoo.

851
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,170
- The zoo.
- What did I do last night?

852
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,928
You don't remember?

853
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,839
Well, I remember seeing you to the door,
and then

854
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,559
saying goodbye,
getting locked out of the flat.

855
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,680
Then I came in through the front window.
I started to read,

856
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,640
and then I woke up naked at the zoo.

857
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,438
I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.

858
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,443
Oh!

859
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,687
Where did you get that coat?

860
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,124
I'll get it.

861
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,331
- Hello?
- Alex, have you heard anything?

862
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:19,871
He's here.

863
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,786
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me?
Where was he?

864
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,294
He doesn't remember.
He woke up at the zoo.

865
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,628
The zoo? Is he rational?

866
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,422
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused.

867
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,757
But he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.

868
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,852
Have you read the papers today?

869
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,849
Or listened to the radio or the television?

870
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,681
- No. Why?
- Is David behaving strangely?

871
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,019
No, he's not really.

872
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:49,027
He's rather enthusiastic.

873
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,069
- Could you get here without any trouble?
- Yes, I should think so.

874
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,490
I want you to bring David here straightaway.
I want him in my care.

875
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,037
I'll notify the police that we've found him.

876
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,250
But it's imperative you bring him
straight to the hospital. You understand?

877
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,373
Yes, Doctor.

878
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,327
Now, you're certain he's lucid?
You won't need any help?

879
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,628
No, he's fine. We'll come right over.

880
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,418
- Shall I send a car?
- A taxi will be faster.

881
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,547
I expect you shortly.

882
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,637
- We should be able to get a taxi here.
- You know, I should be committed.

883
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:24,265
Here we are.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.

884
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,523
I don't know why I feel so good.
I haven't felt this good in a long time.

885
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:30,357
My body feels great. I feel like an athlete.

886
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,903
Let's go back to your place
for a quickie, huh?

887
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,236
- Later.
- Oh, come on. Later, okay.

888
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,322
- Good morning!
- Get in.

889
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,198
I just...

890
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,459
- St. Martin's Hospital.
- Right.

891
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:52,301
It puts you in mind of the days of the
old Demon Barber of Fleet Street, doesn't it?

892
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,835
- Sorry?
- The murders.

893
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,264
- What murders?
- Haven't you heard?

894
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,926
Last night,

895
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:02,644
six of them.

896
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,650
All in different parts of the city,
all mutilated.

897
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,863
He must be a real right maniac, this fella.

898
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,319
- Pull over. Pull over!
- David, we're going to the...

899
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,567
- Pay the man.
- We must get...

900
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:18,817
Wait!

901
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,164
David!

902
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:27,456
- David, stop!
- I'm going to the police!

903
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,791
- Jack was right!
- Jack is dead!

904
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,917
Jack is dead. And six people are dead.

905
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,464
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.
I'm going to the cops.

906
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,508
David, please be rational.
Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

907
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,393
Be rational, sure.
I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!

908
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,891
- David!
- Officer!

909
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,519
Officer, I killed those people last night.

910
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:50,229
- You did, did you?
- He's playing a silly joke, Officer...

911
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,654
- You be quiet.
- We had an argument.

912
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,652
- I don't know this girl.
- All right, you two. Move along, then.

913
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:55,895
Come on. David...

914
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:57,987
Come on.
I want you to arrest me, you asshole!

915
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,162
There's no call for that kind of language.

916
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:06,042
Queen Elizabeth is a man!
Prince Charles is a faggot!

917
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:09,577
- Winston Churchill was full of shit!
- That's enough.

918
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,167
- No! Let go of me!
- David, please!

919
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:14,632
Shakespeare's French! Fuck! Shit!
Cunt! Shit!

920
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,134
- Come on. That's enough.
- David, please!

921
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:17,255
Who is this person?

922
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,631
If you don't stop this disturbance,
I shall arrest you.

923
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,549
That's what I want you to do, you moron!

924
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,097
- He's very upset. His friend was killed.
- Will you shut up?

925
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,641
That's quite enough.
About your business, both of you. Come on.

926
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,690
You're not gonna arrest me?

927
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:32,984
- Don't you think he should arrest me?
- I don't know.

928
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,225
- Perhaps he thinks it's a prank.
- A prank?

929
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,738
- David...
- Look, I've had enough of this foolishness.

930
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,450
All right, come on. There's nothing to see.

931
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,450
- It's hopeless. It's hopeless.
- Let's go.

932
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:45,243
Leave me alone! You people are crazy!

933
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:48,866
- I gotta get out of here!
- David, don't lose control!

934
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,746
Control! What control?

935
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,633
Jack was real. He tried to warn me,
and I thought I was crazy.

936
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,501
- David...
- I love you.

937
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,755
- What?
- I love you.

938
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:02,013
But I think I did some terrible things
last night, things I can't remember.

939
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,604
- David, let's go see Dr. Hirsch.
- No, you gotta stay away from me.

940
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,270
- David, I can help you.
- No, I'm not safe to be with.

941
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,560
You gotta stay away from me.

942
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,771
I love you, Alex.

943
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,319
David!

944
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:24,486
The forensic lab seemed to feel that some
sort of animal was involved, that's true.

945
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,445
- I hardly think it could be...
- Regardless of what you think, Inspector,

946
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,536
the fact remains that David is missing,
and we must find him.

947
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:32,213
- Before nightfall.
- Precisely.

948
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,921
Gentlemen, please.

949
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,801
We shall find Mr. Kessler
as quickly as we're able.

950
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,339
He tried to get himself arrested.

951
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,762
Getting arrested isn't all that difficult,
Miss Price.

952
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,130
He wants help. He really...

953
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,969
- How can we assist you?
- Stay here.

954
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,968
If we need you,
we'll know where to reach you.

955
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:53,479
I cannot accept a connection between
David Kessler and last night's murders.

956
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:56,944
We will find him, however.
I can assure you of that.

957
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:59,645
We'll find him. Not to worry.

958
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:01,816
I promise.

959
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:19,304
Yes, operator, I'd like to call
the United States and reverse the charges.

960
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,545
David Kessler, for anyone.

961
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,182
Thank you. I'll wait.

962
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:30,806
Hello? It's area code 516,

963
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:34,101
472-3402.

964
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:37,063
402.

965
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,863
Thank you.

966
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,110
Hello, Rachel?
Just say yes, you'll accept the charges.

967
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,620
Say yes, Rachel.

968
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:53,326
Hi. Is Mom or Dad at home?

969
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,705
Well, where are they?

970
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,037
Well, where's Max?

971
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,134
You're all alone?

972
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:07,843
Mom and Dad would never leave me alone
when I was 10.

973
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,393
No, not 10-and-a-half, either.

974
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:15,889
I'm still in London. Yes, I'm all better now.

975
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,560
Listen, Rachel,

976
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,400
tell Mom and Dad that I love them, okay?

977
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,071
Just do it for me, will you, please?

978
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:30,907
And

979
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,251
don't fight with Max.

980
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,617
Yeah, well, try.

981
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,250
And please don't forget what I told you
about Mom and Dad.

982
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,247
That I love them.

983
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,844
And I love Max, and I love you, too.

984
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,967
No, I do.

985
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,894
No, I'm not being silly, you little creep.

986
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,767
You promise?

987
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:57,055
Okay.

988
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,496
You be a good girl, then.

989
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:04,904
Yeah, I love you.

990
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,824
Goodbye.

991
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,844
- How much is it?
- £2.80, sir.

992
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,697
Hi, Jack.

993
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,291
Hi, David.

994
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,633
What are you doing here?

995
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,928
You promised never to do
this kind of thing again.

996
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:58,682
- I never promised you any such thing.
- Not you, you twit. Her.

997
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:02,386
- I've never seen you before in my life.
- Oh, sorry.

998
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,281
Good movie.

999
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,073
Mmm-hmm.

1000
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,412
What can I say, Jack?

1001
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,910
You don't have to say anything, David.

1002
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,945
Aren't you gonna say "I told you so"?

1003
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,999
If I were still alive, I probably would.

1004
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,917
But I did tell you so, you schmuck.

1005
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,839
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

1006
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,012
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1007
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,928
I don't know what I'm saying.

1008
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,813
I don't even know if it was me
that killed those people last night.

1009
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,681
I don't remember doing it.

1010
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,270
What about the zoo?

1011
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:50,234
Well, even if I'm not the Wolf Man,

1012
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,107
I'm crazy enough to do something like that.

1013
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:56,775
Look at me. Here I sit in a porno theater
in Piccadilly Circus

1014
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,655
talking to a corpse.

1015
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,950
I'm actually glad to see you, Jack.

1016
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,212
I want you to meet some people.

1017
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:11,297
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsley.

1018
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,382
Gerald's the man you murdered
on the subway.

1019
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:20,968
We thought it best for you not to see him,
as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.

1020
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:25,267
Yes. I do look most unpleasant.

1021
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,312
Why are you doing this to me?

1022
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:31,106
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
He's your good friend,

1023
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:35,948
whereas I am a victim
of your carnivorous lunar activities.

1024
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:40,488
Mr. Bringsley, I'm sorry.

1025
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,080
I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.

1026
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:48,173
You've left my wife a widow
and my children fatherless.

1027
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:53,377
And, I understand, I am to walk
the Earth in limbo, one of the living dead,

1028
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:57,382
until the wolf's bloodline is severed
and the curse lifted.

1029
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:04,968
You must die, David Kessler.

1030
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,599
David?

1031
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:12,937
This is Harry Berman and his fiancée,
Judith Browns.

1032
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:14,982
- Hello.
- Hello.

1033
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:19,362
And these gentlemen are
Alf, Ted and Joseph.

1034
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:22,533
Can't say we're pleased to meet you,
Mr. Kessler.

1035
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,408
What shall I do?

1036
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,829
- Suicide.
- You must take your own life.

1037
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:31,286
That's easy for you to say.
You're already dead.

1038
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:36,336
No, David. Harry and I and everyone
you murdered are not dead, the undead.

1039
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,632
Why are you doing this to me?

1040
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,551
Because this must be stopped.

1041
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,433
How shall I do it?

1042
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,136
- Sleeping pills?
- Not sure enough.

1043
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,019
- I could hang myself.
- No.

1044
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,780
No, if you did it wrong, it could be painful.
You'd choke to death.

1045
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:59,453
- So what? Let him choke!
- Do you mind? The man's a friend of mine!

1046
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:03,240
- Well, he ain't no friend to me.
- Gentlemen, please.

1047
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,827
- A gun!
- I know where you can get a gun.

1048
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:10,832
- Don't I need a silver bullet or something?
- Oh, be serious, would you?

1049
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,956
- Madness.
- No, a gun would be good.

1050
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:15,883
Yes. Just put the gun to your forehead
and pull the trigger.

1051
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:18,593
But if you put it in your mouth,
you'd be sure not to miss.

1052
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:22,684
- Thank you. You're all so thoughtful.
- A knife!

1053
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:25,096
- An electric shock!
- A car crash?

1054
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:28,064
- You could throw yourself in front of a tube.
- Drowning.

1055
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,300
Don't stop!

1056
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:14,395
Go away.

1057
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,900
Please, go away.

1058
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,607
Please, run!

1059
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,332
What was that?

1060
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,918
- I don't know!
- I'll check on the house.

1061
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,176
Hello?

1062
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,643
No, I'm sorry.

1063
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,903
No, nobody of that name.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

1064
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:56,807
Help! Help!

1065
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:59,069
- Help!
- What's the matter?

1066
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:01,361
- There's a mad thing in there!
- Where?

1067
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,613
- A mad dog is tearing...
- Calm down!

1068
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:06,545
- Oh, do something!
- Quit shouting!

1069
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:13,199
Oh, right there. Yeah, right there.

1070
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:17,746
Oh, yeah, harder. Oh, yeah.

1071
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,376
Jesus Christ.

1072
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,568
Oh, here he is.

1073
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,082
For Christ's sake, John,
there's a monster in there!

1074
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,370
Call for assistance!

1075
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,910
Tell them to bring rifles!

1076
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,880
Will you people get out of the way!

1077
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:33,450
- What the hell's going on here?
- Some kind of animal, sir.

1078
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,997
Sister Hobbs said there's a disturbance
in Piccadilly Circus

1079
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,959
involving some sort of mad dog.

1080
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,259
David!

1081
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,067
It's a dead end down there!

1082
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,775
Clear this street off!

1083
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:28,515
David. It's David.

1084
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,902
Alex. Alex!

1085
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,681
- Let me through!
- Stand aside, miss!

1086
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,478
You must let me through!

1087
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:10,234
- Come back!
- Alex!

1088
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,788
David? Is it you?

1089
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:39,138
David.

1090
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,018
They're going to kill you.

1091
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:49,314
David.

1092
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,860
Please.

1093
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,739
Please let me help you.

1094
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,370
I love you, David.

01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:04,678
Blue moon

1103
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:08,644
You saw me standing alone

1104
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:12,438
Without a dream in my heart

1105
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:16,034
Without a love of my own

1106
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:18,569
A-dang-a-dang-dang a-ding-a-dong-ding

Blue moon

1108
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:24,782
You knew just what I was there for

1109
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:28,539
You heard me saying a prayer for

1110
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:32,211
Someone I really could care for

1111
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:39,376
And then there suddenly appeared before me

1112
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:46,969
The only one my arms would ever hold

1113
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:53,936
I heard somebody whisper please adore me

1114
01:34:55,690 --> 01:35:01,450
And when I looked
the moon had turned to gold

1115
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,985
Blue moon

1116
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:09,786
Now I'm no longer alone

1117
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:13,421
Without a dream in my heart

1118
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,710
Without a love of my own

You saw me standing alone

And then there suddenly appeared before me

The only one my arms would ever hold

I heard somebody whisper please adore me

And when I looked

Blue moon
